#How to use the application
Insert a type of media or artist name or song and more in the search input.
To add items to favourite list select the add to favourite button to submit.


#information of the Application
This application uses an iTune api to generate data requested in the input. Also the user is able to inlude a song, movie, audiobook or music video to the favourite list.

#FunNote:
I used helmet specifically the dnsPreFetching() call to protect the app from being limited due to lack of header-type if necessary.


#How the api keys have been dealt with 
the keys are set appropriately in the query-string section of the link and everything speicifed according to the itunes api recommendation of use.
The api needs to be specified and set with th right parameters to locate the specific query and to respond accordingly.
